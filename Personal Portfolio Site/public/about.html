            <!-- When one thinks about themselves, they tend to run into problems. "Do I actually work hard?" "Am I
            actually
            funny?" "Do aliens ever think about us?" All common questions that arise
            while trying to describe oneself. Thus, I will be blunt and straight to the point. I try to be funny. A
            lot.
            I enjoy my laughs when I can get 'em in. I fancy myself a good writer
            (of code, of prose, of poetry, you name it). I am very much not good at drawing, but that's okay, there
            are
            other people for that. When it comes time to be professional, I am. There
            are times and places, and though I love to have fun at work, I know when to put a hold on the fun.
            However,
            this is my website, so I'll do as I please. Another thing I love: helping.
            If anyone I know (and usually people I don't know as well) asks for help with anything, I try my hardest
            to
            get them the help they need. I've always made the joke that I am my family's
            IT department because I love helping them, and I know way more about technology than them. Working for a
            company that helps people in need (or not, just helping is great as it is) is
            all I could ever ask for, and I couldn't utter a more truthful sentence if I said I stare at screens for
            my
            major. -->
